This project contains the R scripts, data and a Fortran routine that can be used
to replicate the results and figures presented in [1].

mproot-Mac and mproot-Linux directores contain a Fortran routine for solving Equation 
1 from the paper using the Newton-Raphson algoritm. These directories have the code 
compiled for Mac and Lunux platforms.

To compile the routine for your platform and to call it from R, use the 
following commands:

R CMD COMPILE mproot.f
R CMD SHLIB mproot.o

If you use this code in any publication, please cite [1].
